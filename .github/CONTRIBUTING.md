# Contributing to Paw Wars

:smiley_cat: You're awesome!

There's a number of ways you can help:
* Play the game!  
	* Playing and giving your opinion of the game is a lot of help!  
	* If you think you've found a bug, open up a [new issue](https://github.com/snollygolly/paw-wars/issues/new) and describe the bug the best you can.  
	* If you have an opinion about game balance, please describe your issue in the existing [balance issue](https://github.com/snollygolly/paw-wars/issues/32).


* Spread the word!
	* The more people you tell about Paw Wars, the bigger and better it can become.


* Fix an issue!
	* We have a tag called [good first issue](https://github.com/snollygolly/paw-wars/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that will show you all the issues we think would be good for your first time.
	* If one interests you, be sure to comment in the issue and let people know you'll be working on it.
	* If you want to help, but don't quite understand something, ask for clarification in the issue and we'll be happy to help.


* Shape the game!
	* If you've done a few easy issues, try one of the other ones marked [help wanted](https://github.com/snollygolly/paw-wars/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).  
	* These are typically issues we want community help with, but they might be complex or require vision on where you'd like the game to go.
	* This is a great way to add a little bit of yourself into the game and affect change at a greater level.
